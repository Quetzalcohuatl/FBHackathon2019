Webhooks (Used to receive callbacks whenever user replies)

Messenger Postman Collection lists out all the various Messenger APIs

# IDEA # # # # # #
competiive groups submitting through messenger
(for example, submitting witty jokes that are voted to the best joke of the day)
(for example, submitting company logos that are voted to the best)

Then additionally you should be able use the bot to vote for other things (eg swipe right/left if you like it, or show 2 different things and ask which you like better)

Can award medals/prizes based on voting, and based on how many times someone has won/how they performed on the leaderboard
